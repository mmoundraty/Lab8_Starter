Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that service workers help implement graceful degradation by allowing a website to function even when network conditions are unavailable. Service workers can handle requests offline making sure that users still experience core functionality. This supports graceful degradation by providing a usable experience even without full connectivity or advanced features.
